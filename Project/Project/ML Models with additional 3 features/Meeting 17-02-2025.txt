- Ask Patrick about the negative cross-validation scores.
- Ask Patrick about the warning message:
	The warning:

	"Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples."

	occurs when some classes in your dataset are never predicted by the classification model. This can happen when:

		The model completely ignores some classes.
		The dataset is highly imbalanced, leading to some labels being underrepresented.
		The post-pruning process removes important branches, affecting predictions.

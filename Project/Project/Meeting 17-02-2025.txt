- Apply 10 cross-validation for all of models (Done)
- Study the meaning of cross-validation scores
- Remove the interrupted calls feature (Done)

- For the general dataset (Done)
	- Redo the experiments (Done)
	- interpret the importance of the features (Done)

- Split the dataset based on the machines and jobs which are (3 classes)
	- apply the different algorithms on each dataset
	- interpret the importance of the features

- Check what happens if the max depth parameter does not exist

- According to the normal Classification and the regression tree (do it with the general and splitted dataset)
	- How to do post pruning (it is the opposite of pre-pruning) [need to study it]
